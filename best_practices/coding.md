We cant be agile if our code sucks
Code is how we tell our colleagues how we feel about them!

The quality of code is inversely proportional to the effort it takes to understand it


1. Schedule time to lower the technical debt
   - What is technical debt
     - Use of deprecated methods
     - Upgrading a library that is not too performant
     - Tighter deadlines causes technical debt
     - Assign some time from your sprint to lower this debt rather than accumulating it
     - Its important to have slack time in order to innovate

2. Maintain code with high cohesion
    - Longer methods are not cohesive by nature
    - Keep only the things that are related to a class in that class

3. Favour loose coupling
   - In fact eliminate all kinds of coupling

4. Program with intention
   - Rules for simple design
      - Passes the tests
      - Reveals intentions
      - No duplication
      - Fewest elements(minimalistic code)
      - Write test before writing code

5. Avoid primitive obsession
    - Do not reinvent the wheel when something is already available
      - e.g. Do not write your own implementation of checking whether a collection is empty when the apache already provides CollectionUtils.isEmpty(collection)
    -  Try to avoid imperative programming as it enforces creating many local variables and spaghetti code which is hard to understand at first
      - A good code should read like a story, not a puzzle

e.g.: Compare the below two code snippets which finds the sum of the sqrt of k prime numbers starting with n
private static  double getSumFunctional(Integer n, Integer k) {
         
         return Stream.iterate(n,e->e+1)
                      .filter(Iteration::isPrime)
                      .mapToDouble(Math::sqrt)
                      .limit(k)
                      .sum();
                 
     }


private static double getSumInperative(Integer n, Integer k) {
         
         int start=n;
         int count=0;
         
         double total=0;
         
         while(count<k) {
             
             if(isPrime(start)) {
                 total+=Math.sqrt(start);
                 count++;
             }
             
             start++;
         }
         
         return total;
     }

6. Write clear code and not clever code
   - 10% of the time we write ugly code for performance reasons and 90% of the times , only to be consistent
            
7. Apply Zinssers principle on Writing
    - Avoid mutability
    - Write clear code(put cohesive stuff together)
    - Brevity(shorter the better, keep classes and functions smaller. Better class, functions  and variable names)
    - Humanity

8. Comment why and not what
    - e.g. I++//increment
    - Comments are used to hide the bad code
    - Write expressive and self-documenting code
    - A good code is like good joke(a good joke needs no explanation!!)
    - Use comments to describe the purpose and the constraints of the code

9. Avoid long methods
   - Becomes hard to understand what the method is doing
   - Leads to duplication
   - Becomes non-testable
   - Low cohesions and high coupling
   - Long methods become longer
   - Too many levels of indentation(nested loops)

10. Give good meaningful names
    - Programmer: one who can name their children quite easily but have a difficult time naming the variables
    - If we canâ€™t name a function or a variable  appropriately, it means that we have not understood its true purpose well

11. Do tactical code reviews
    - Review the test before reviewing the code
    - Rotate the developers who do the Code review
    - Code review has to be valuable and not administrative
    - Never say whats wrong, rather say what can be better
    - Code reviews are technical+sociological
    - Peer reviews catch 60% defects in code
            
12. Reduce state and state mutation
    - Try to remove mutability as much as possible
